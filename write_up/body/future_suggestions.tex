\begin{itemize}
    \item Gaussian process has gaussian process for variance, run any set of parameters multiple times, have very large length scale, maybe a prior on it
    \item Add in an artificial variance for the values where the disease dies off
    \item t-process to allow for sudden drop off at threshold
    \item Maybe use matern to allow for sudden jump but I think that allows for very small sudden jumps
    \item Used a relative distance squared
\end{itemize}
