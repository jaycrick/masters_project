\chapter{Stuff that could fix stuff}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gaussian process has gaussian process for variance, run any set of parameters multiple times, have very large length scale, maybe a prior on it
    \item Add in an artificial variance for the values where the disease dies off
    \item t-process to allow for sudden drop off at threshold/ bifurcations
    \item Maybe use matern to allow for sudden jump but I think that allows for very small sudden jumps
    \item Used a relative distance squared
    \item Using log-discrepency doesn't allow you to take a limiting argument, and might depend a lot of the size of the error you allow. Should do some calculations to work that out, because the important thing is that the differences have constant ratio
    \item The use of LC?\ acquisition function does not encourage a broad searching of the parameter space.
