\chapter{Introduction}

All the stuff that's really hard about calibrating malaria model parameters.
Recent model don't even calibrate using their models.

Why are we looking at mathematical models for vivax malaria and why do we need 
to do more complicated parameter inference. Outline that the limitation is that 
it takes a long time to run simulations from complicated malaria models and we 
still need to fit to data.

The aim of this thesis was to investigate the use of Gaussian Processes to
