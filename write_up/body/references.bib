Most of these cases originate from Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, although a significant number also occurs in Africa and South America. Although often regarded as causing a benign and self-limiting infection, there is increasing evidence that the overall burden, economic impact, and severity of disease from P. vivax have been underestimated. Malaria control strategies have had limited success and are confounded by the lack of access to reliable diagnosis, emergence of multidrug resistant isolates, the parasite’s ability to transmit early in the course of disease and relapse from dormant liver stages at varying time intervals after the initial infection. Progress in reducing the burden of disease will require improved access to reliable diagnosis and effective treatment of both blood-stage and latent parasites, and more detailed characterization of the epidemiology, morbidity, and economic impact of vivax malaria. Without these, vivax malaria will continue to be neglected by ministries of health, policy makers, researchers, and funding bodies.},

Whilst enhanced malaria-control activities have successfully reduced the incidence of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in many areas, there has been a consistent increase in the proportion of malaria due to P. vivax in regions where both parasites coexist. This article reviews the epidemiology and biology of P. vivax, how the parasite differs from P. falciparum, and the key features that render it more difficult to control and eliminate. Since transmission of the parasite is driven largely by relapses from dormant liver stages, its timely elimination will require widespread access to safe and effective radical cure. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Naturally acquired immunity to falciparum malaria protects millions of people routinely exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection from severe disease and death. There is no clear concept about how this protection works. There is no general agreement about the rate of onset of acquired immunity or what constitutes the key determinants of protection; much less is there a consensus regarding the mechanism(s) of protection. This review summarizes what is understood about naturally acquired and experimentally induced immunity against malaria with the help of evolving insights provided by biotechnology and places these insights in the context of historical, clinical, and epidemiological observations. We advocate that naturally acquired immunity should be appreciated as being virtually 100\% effective against severe disease and death among heavily exposed adults. Even the immunity that occurs in exposed infants may exceed 90\% effectiveness. The induction of an adult-like immune status among high-risk infants in sub-Saharan Africa would greatly diminish disease and death caused by P. falciparum. The mechanism of naturally acquired immunity that occurs among adults living in areas of hyper- to holoendemicity should be understood with a view toward duplicating such protection in infants and young children in areas of endemicity.},

	abstract = {Background
Malaria remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in Africa. Many approaches to malaria control involve reducing the chances of infection but little is known of the relations between parasite exposure and the development of effective clinical immunity so the long-term effect of such approaches to control on the pattern and frequency of malaria cannot be predicted.
Methods
We have prospectively recorded paediatric admissions with severe malaria over three to five years from five discrete communities in The Gambia and Kenya. Demographic analysis of the communities exposed to disease risk allowed the estimation of age-specific rates for severe malaria. Within each community the exposure to Plasmodium falciparum infection was determined through repeated parasitological and serological surveys among children and infants. We used acute respiratory-tract infections (ARI) as a comparison.
Findings
3556 malaria admissions were recorded for the five sites. Marked differences were observed in age, clinical spectrum and rates of severe malaria between the five sites. Paradoxically, the risks of severe disease in childhood were lowest among populations with the highest transmission intensities, and the highest disease risks were observed among populations exposed to low-to-moderate intensities of transmission. For severe malaria, for example, admission rates (per 1000 per year) for children up to their 10th birthday were estimated as 3·9, 25·8, 25·9, 16·7, and 18·0 in the five communities; the forces of infection estimated for those communities (new infections per infant per month) were 0·001, 0·034, 0·050, 0·093, and 0·176, respectively. Similar trends were noted for cerebral malaria and for severe malaria anaemia but not for ARI. Mean age of disease decreased with increasing transmission intensity.
Interpretation
We propose that a critical determinant of life-time disease risk is the ability to develop clinical immunity early in life during a period when other protective mechanisms may operate. In highly endemic areas measures which reduce parasite transmission, and thus immunity, may lead to a change in both the clinical spectrum of severe disease and the overall burden of severe malaria morbidity.},

A systematic historical review suggests that several mathematicians and scientists contributed to development of the Ross-Macdonald model over a period of 70 years. Ross developed two different mathematical models, Macdonald a third, and various “Ross-Macdonald” mathematical models exist. Ross-Macdonald models are best defined by a consensus set of assumptions. The mathematical model is just one part of a theory for the dynamics and control of mosquito-transmitted pathogens that also includes epidemiological and entomological concepts and metrics for measuring transmission. All the basic elements of the theory had fallen into place by the end of the Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP, 1955–1969) with the concept of vectorial capacity, methods for measuring key components of transmission by mosquitoes, and a quantitative theory of vector control. The Ross-Macdonald theory has since played a central role in development of research on mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and the development of strategies for mosquito-borne disease prevention.},

In the human host, only a small number of these morphological stages lead to clinical disease and the vast majority of all malaria-infected patients in the world produce few (if any) symptoms in the human.

In many settings in PNG, increasing bed net coverage is predicted to reduce transmission to less than 0.1\% prevalence by light microscopy, however there is substantial risk of rebounds in transmission if interventions are removed prematurely. In several high transmission settings, model simulations predict that combinations of existing interventions are not sufficient to interrupt

Estimates of transmission and prevalence intensity can be problematic because many episodes of vivax originate from hypnozoite stages in the liver that have remained dormant from previous infections by an unknown mechanism. Lack of treatment options to clear hypnozoites and the ability to infect mosquitoes before disease symptoms present represent major challenges for control and eradication of vivax malaria. Compounding these challenges is the unique biology of P. vivax and limited progress in development of experimental research tools, thereby hindering development of new drugs and vaccines. Renewed emphasis on vivax malaria research is beginning to make progress in overcoming some of these challenges., The majority of malaria cases in Asia and the Americas are caused by Plasmodium vivax.

This article uses new computational methods and social media to describe AAVE variation and to show AAVE dialect regions distinct from—and perpendicular to—the regions of other dialects of North American English. This study maps the geographic patterns of 30+ common nonstandard spellings on Twitter (e.g., sholl ‘sure’). It shows that nonstandard AAVE orthography delineates distinct dialect regions with shared phonological and lexical features. These regions are not coterminous with traditional North American dialect regions; rather, they align with patterns of movement during the Great Migrations.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning are in a period of astounding growth. However, there are concerns that these technologies may be used, either with or without intention, to perpetuate the prejudice and unfairness that unfortunately characterizes many human institutions. Here we show for the first time that human-like semantic biases result from the application of standard machine learning to ordinary language---the same sort of language humans are exposed to every day. We replicate a spectrum of standard human biases as exposed by the Implicit Association Test and other well-known psychological studies. We replicate these using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model---namely, the GloVe word embedding---trained on a corpus of text from the Web. Our results indicate that language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the \{{\textbackslash}em status quo\} for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names. These regularities are captured by machine learning along with the rest of semantics. In addition to our empirical findings concerning language, we also contribute new methods for evaluating bias in text, the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) and the Word Embedding Factual Association Test (WEFAT). Our results have implications not only for AI and machine learning, but also for the fields of psychology, sociology, and human ethics, since they raise the possibility that mere exposure to everyday language can account for the biases we replicate here.},

              Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves
              1
              and in the first imaging of a black hole
              2
              . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT. We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.},

The article engages the recent work on authoritarian resilience in comparative politics but goes beyond the standard focus on elections to other important institutions, such as the media and courts, that are used by authoritarian leaders to bolster legitimacy. The authors find that the Chinese media contribute to regime legitimacy and effective rule by propagandizing citizens? experiences in the legal system. However, unlike the ?mouthpieces? of earlier communist regimes, the marketized Chinese media provide more convincing and sophisticated messages that continue to accord with state censorship demands while satisfying readers? interest in real-life stories and problems. The ?positive propaganda? and the relative uniformity of information sources because of state censorship lead aggrieved citizens to the law as a realm for dispute resolution and rights protection. Statistical analysis of a randomly sampled survey conducted in four Chinese cities in 2005 demonstrates that exposure to media reporting about labor-law-related issues successfully promotes the image of a proworker bias in the law among citizens, thus encouraging them to participate in the legal system. The state is able to achieve its political goal because of the lack of conflicting sources of information and the lack of previous experience with the reformed legal system among citizens.},

Xinhua News Agency was surprisingly more episodic than The Paper in framing the pandemic. The Paper, however, had a higher level of user engagement than Xinhua News Agency.

Some researchers hold that public opinion toward China in African nations has been improving because of the increased media presence. Others argue that the impact is rather limited, particularly when it comes to affecting how African media cover China-related stories. This article contributes to this debate by exploring the extent to which news media in 30 African countries relied on Chinese news sources to cover China and the COVID-19 outbreak during the first-half of 2020. By computationally analyzing a corpus of 500,000 written news stories, this paper shows that, compared to other major global players (e.g. Reuters, AFP), content distributed by Chinese media (e.g. Xinhua, China Daily) is much less likely to be used by African news organizations, both in English and French speaking countries. The analysis also reveals a gap in the prevailing themes in Chinese and African media?s coverage of the pandemic. The implications of these findings for the sub-field of Sino-African media relations, and the study of global news flows are discussed.},

Over the years, the propaganda apparatus has banned fewer reports but guided more of them. However, this softer approach of regulating news is not equally enforced on every report or by different censorship authorities. First, the party tends to ban news that directly threatens the legitimacy of the regime.

	abstract = {China's growing economic influence in Africa, and in the sub-Saharan region in particular, has drawn enormous attention around the world, especially in the West. An important but as yet under-studied aspect of China's increasing presence in Africa is related to the question about whether the party-state will exert its ideological influence on local politics and public space through media expansion in this region. Media initiatives associated with the 'Going abroad' project have been in full swing in recent years, in parallel with the growing concern by Chinese authorities about the mismatch between China's strong economic power and weak media influence. This paper focuses on Xinhua News Agency. Xinhua's major forms of intervention in Africa include setting up bureaux, developing news portfolio targeting African audiences, exchanging news with (or selling news wires to) African media subscribers, and providing technical equipment and support as well as training African journalists. The first two forms of intervention have been on top of Xinhua's agenda in recent years and will be the focus of this article. The increasing presence of Xinhua in Africa sheds some light on the debate on 'media imperialism' and international news flows in the context of China's economic rise. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

This article extends this finding by arguing that Chinese censors respond differently to political challenges than they do to performance challenges. Political challenges call into questioning the Party's leading role, whereas performance challenges are directed at the failures of public goods provisions. A survey experiment of about 60 media professionals finds that censors are inclined to block political challenges and to tolerate criticism of the government's performance. However, when criticism contains both performance and political challenges, censorship is far more likely. By exploring the range of censorship activities, the results suggest that the Chinese regime's reliance on popular support constrains its censorship decisions.},

Thematic analysis of the main themes in the news articles shows dominant positive coverage of China's economic development. Using qualitative content analysis, it also investigates the breeding of the 'emergence' of constructive journalism practices in China. It finds that Xinhua prioritises the frames of referring to solutions to the conflict and problem and mentioning the social and economic stability, sustainability, and prosperous development. The frames of moral judgement, conflict and its formation, and human interest are less applied in news articles. It bears elements of constructive journalism, but still needs efforts to make a clear division from positive journalism and Party journalism. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Using content analysis of social media headline articles, this article argues that key Islamophobic actors in the Chinese cyberspace have constructed a ‘victims and villains’ narrative to effectively ‘other’ Muslim populations in China. By implying that non-Sinicised Muslims are under Arab fundamentalist influences, religious autonomy becomes political betrayal and Islamophobia is legitimised. Elements of Islamophobia is then subsumed in the official narrative calling for ethnic loyalty to the Chinese nation, which presents a unique challenge to the Chinese Party-state as Islamophobic discourses both legitimises state-sponsored autocratic control in Muslim regions, but also could potentially bring destabilisation to an already fragile ethnic relationship between Muslim minorities and the Han majority.},

The religious traditions that were active at that time, other than Islam, were local community traditions of ritual and belief, popular religious sects, Daoism and Buddhism. Of these, local community traditions were by far the most numerous and widespread, based on family and temple worship in villages and urban neighbourhoods. They were not sectarian, but involved all who lived in the local area. However there were sectarian religions in China as well, with their own founders, members, scriptures and worship centres, including indigenous popular religious sects, Daoism, Buddhism and Roman Catholic Christianity. Summaries of their histories and activities are provided, together with comments about their relationships with Protestants. The second part of this article is a brief comparison of Protestant Christianity in the Chinese empire with that of the early Christian movement in the Roman world. Though there were many differences, in both situations the majority tradition was of polytheistic cults of gods represented by images and paintings in homes and temples; gods worshipped for practical goals by families and communities. The article ends with a few suggested reasons for the success of Christianity in the Roman Empire, with implied parallels for the Protestant movement in China centuries later.]},

This article explores the ways in which Spirit-oriented authority is produced through sensational forms in popular Christianity in China. Based on extensive ethnographic research in urban “Three-Self”-affiliated churches in China between 2009 and 2015, I argue that officially recognized “Three-Self” congregations maintain their legitimacy in the broader Protestant community through sensorially rich encounters with the Holy Spirit, which, at the same time, have the capacity to unnerve the state because they go beyond officially defined limits on religious activity. This article contributes to our understanding of how state-sanctioned religious institutions are (carefully) engaging with the wider “signs and wonders” movement in China and suggests that aesthetic approaches to examining Christianity in China might provide an alternative lens to the problematic and somewhat tired distinction between congregations categorized as “Three-Self” and “house church.”]},

This is a relatively stable religious population, whose growth depends largely on the continuity of the family and the community. To explore the origins of this legacy, this article studies the formation and early development of Chinese Catholic communities in Northeast China and their models of religious governance. It argues that the widespread Catholic missions since the 19th century diffused not only religion but also notions of autonomy and models of local governance among Chinese Christians. Based on archival research and fieldwork, the article focuses on two Catholic communities in Northeast China. These two cases demonstrate that the early development of Northeast Catholic communities was largely due to immigration and the absence of the state. The growth of the community coincided with the formation of local society. Although the expansion of state power to rural society gradually eroded the traditional nexus of power at the village level, the local religious order in the Catholic communities survived until the mid-20th century. This religious autonomy left a legacy that turned out to be extremely problematic in the post-1949 era. From a historical perspective, this study contributes to our understanding of contemporary outcomes for the Chinese Catholic population and the origins of China’s church-state relations at the grassroots level.]},

This is surprising given that, first, both Catholic and Protestant communities were small and, second, that violence against other potential threats—counterrevolutionaries and landlords—was severe. I suggest the goal for the local Department of United Front (統戰部 tongzhan bu) was not to eradicate Christianity by force but to divide the church into those who would submit themselves to the communist utopia and isolate the hard-core devotees with the expectation that both would eventually die out without “contaminating” the emerging socialist subjects. The regulatory process was one in which the state power attempted to remove the Christian transcendence with a communist one.

The Qing Empire (1644–1911), the world's largest national economy before 1800, experienced a tripling of population during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with no signs of diminishing per capita income. While the timing remains in dispute, a vast gap emerged between newly rich industrial nations and China's lagging economy in the wake of the Industrial Revolution. Only with an unprecedented growth spurt beginning in the late 1970s did this great divergence separating China from the global leaders substantially diminish, allowing China to regain its former standing among the world's largest economies. This essay develops an integrated framework for understanding that entire history, including both the divergence and the recent convergent trend. We explain how deeply embedded political and economic institutions that contributed to a long process of extensive growth before 1800 subsequently prevented China from capturing the benefits associated with the Industrial Revolution. During the twentieth century, the gradual erosion of these historic constraints and of new obstacles erected by socialist planning eventually opened the door to China's current boom. Our analysis links China's recent development to important elements of its past, while using recent success to provide fresh perspectives on the critical obstacles undermining earlier modernization efforts, and their eventual removal.]},

	abstract = {The consensus among economists is that China’s post-1978 market reform policies have produced one of the world’s greatest economic success stories. Some progressives believe that China is now capable of serving as an anchor for a new (non-U.S. dominated) global economy. A few claim that the reform experience demonstrates the workability (and desirability) of market socialism. This article is critical of these views. Its four main conclusions are as follows: first, the reforms have led to the restoration of capitalism, not a new form of market socialism. Second, the gains attributed to the reforms have been seriously overstated. Early successes were largely due to the economic foundation established during the pre-reform Mao era. Moreover, the reform process has begun to undermine this foundation, increasing the country’s dependence on foreign investment, technology, and markets. Third, the reforms have produced an increasingly exploitative growth process, one that generates considerable wealth for a minority at unacceptably high cost for the majority. Finally, the reforms also produced a growth process whose logic led it to become enmeshed in, and dependent upon, a broader process of transnational restructuring, one controlled by transnational capital. As a result, China is not only incapable of serving as an anchor for an alternative global economy, its accumulation dynamics actually contribute to the strengthening of existing structures of power and the global imbalances and tensions they generate.

In this chapter, I focus on one blogging phenomenon in particular, the Anti-CNN website established in the Chinese blogosphere, in order to portray how the Chinese government also regulates nationalism to prevent it from getting out of control. I argue that although party propaganda does not cause the nationalist sentiments of Chinese bloggers, as is the dominant perception in the West, those sentiments are, as suggested recently (Fong 2004; Zhao 2002; Zhou 2005), not free from},

Three variables (which measure good governance, democratic rights, and welfare gains) are then chosen from among all strongly correlated variables as being the most plausible basis for a causal theory. The theory is then further tested using 31 pairs of countries with similar income levels and in similar regions, which shows a significant positive correlation between performance and legitimacy. The article concludes with suggestions for further research. /// Cet article examine une gamme de variables potentiellement causales de la légitimité d'État appliquées à un ensemble globalement représentatif de 72 pays couvrant 83\% de la population mondiale.

Parmi toutes les variables fortement corrélées, sont alors retenues trois d'entre elles -- qui mesurent le bon gouvernement, les droits démocratiques et le développement de l'assistance sociale -- car constituant la base la plus plausible d'une théorie causale.

	abstract = {Political legitimacy is a virtue of political institutions and of thedecisions—about laws, policies, and candidates for politicaloffice—made within them. This entry will survey the main answersthat have been given to the following questions. First, how shouldlegitimacy be defined? Is it primarily a descriptive or a normativeconcept? If legitimacy is understood normatively, what does it entail?Some associate legitimacy with the justification of coercive power andwith the creation of political authority. Others associate it with thejustification, or at least the sanctioning, of existing politicalauthority. Authority stands for a right to rule—a right to issuecommands and, possibly, to enforce these commands using coercivepower. An additional question is whether legitimate politicalauthority is understood to entail political obligations or not. Mostpeople probably think it does. But some think that the moralobligation to obey political authority can be separated from anaccount of legitimate authority, or at least that such obligationsarise only if further conditions hold., Next there are questions about the requirements of legitimacy. Whenare political institutions and the decisions made within themappropriately called legitimate? Some have argued that this questionhas to be answered primarily on the basis of procedural features thatshape these institutions and underlie the decisions made. Others arguethat legitimacy depends—exclusively or at least in part—onthe substantive values that are realized. A related question is: doespolitical legitimacy demand democracy or not? This question isintensely debated both in the national and the global context. Insofaras democracy is seen as necessary for political legitimacy, when aredemocratic decisions legitimate? Can that question be answered withreference to procedural features only, or does democratic legitimacydepend both on procedural values and on the quality of the decisionsmade? Finally, there is the question which political institutions aresubject to the legitimacy requirement. Historically, legitimacy wasassociated with the state and institutions and decisions within thestate. The contemporary literature tends to judge this as too narrow,however. This raises the question how the concept of legitimacy mayapply—beyond the nation state and decisions made withinit—to the international and global context.},

	abstract = {Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography done during headupright tilt induced neurocardiogenic syncope has demonstrated that cerebral Vasoconstriction occurs concomitant with (or precedes) loss of consciousness. This article demonstrates evidence that cerebral blood flow changes alone (vasoconstriction), in the absence of systemic hypotension, may result in syncope. Five patients (4 men, 1 woman; mean age 41 ± 17 years) with recurrent unexplained syncope were evaluated by use of an upright tilt table test for 45 minutes with or without an infusion of low dose isoproterenol. TCDoppler ultrasonography was used to assess middle cerebral artery systolic velocity (Vs); diastolic velocity (Vd); mean velocity (Vm); and pulsatility index (PI = Vs = Vd/Vmean). Syncope occurred in five patients during the baseline tilt and in one patient during isoproterenol infusion. During tilt induced syncope, at an average mean arterial pressure of 89 ± 16 mmHg, TCD sonography showed a 2\%± 10\% increase in systolic velocity; a 51\%± 27\% decrease in diastolic velocity; and a 131 \%± 87\% increase in pulsatility index. One patient underwent continuous electroencephalographic recording during tilt, which demonstrated diffuse slow wave activity (indicating cerebral hypoxia) at the time of syncope concomitant with the aforementioned TCD changes in the absence of systemic hypotension. These fndings reflect an increase in cerebrovascular resistance secondary to arteriolar vasoconstriction distal to the insonation point of the middle cerebral artery, that occurred concomitant with loss of consciousness and in the absence of systemic hypotension. We conclude that in some individuals abnormal baroreceptor responses triggered during orthostatic stress may result in a derangement of cerebral autoregulation leading to cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant cerebral hypoxia in the absence of systemic hypotension.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose: Cerebral syncope refers to a loss of consciousness associated with cerebral vasoconstriction in the absence of systemic hypotension. The diagnosis of cerebral syncope could be established by the head-up tilt test (HUT) and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. Valsalva maneuver (VM) permitted assessment of cerebral autoregulatory function by provoking blood pressure (BP) changes. To develop a path-physiological approach for vasomotor reactivity of cerebral syncope, the authors combined these maneuvers (HUT/transcranial Doppler/VM). Methods: Using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, we simultaneously recorded systemic arterial BP in the radial artery and flow velocities in both middle cerebral arteries (MCAFV) in 10 cerebral syncope patients (4 males and 6 females, 35.24 ± 4.5 years old) during the Valsalva maneuver. Results: The characteristic changes in BP (phases I-IV) were seen in all subjects, accompanying distinct changes in cerebral blood flow velocity. The BP/heart rate responding to VM was within normal limit in all subjects. There was no orthostatic hypotension. Instead, BP increased during the tilting test in 2 subjects (20.00\%). The MCAFV dropped 25.4 ± 2.3\% from baseline. Abnormal flattening of MCAFV during late phase II (IIb), the paradoxical drop of flow velocity despite restoration of BP, was noted in 9 subjects (90.00\%). Conclusion: During VM there are complex changes in relevant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular variables within a short time span. The paradoxical drop of MCAFV during phase IIb was the result of complex parameters. Among them, a failure in cerebrovascular resistance reduction and even paradoxical vasoconstriction might further compromise cerebral perfusion pressure and lead to syncope.

        Purpose 
        Repetitive resistance exercise with large muscle mass causes rapid fluctuations in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). We sought to determine the effect of these fluctuations on the cerebrovasculature response determined by mean flow velocity (Vmean) of the middle cerebral artery.
        Methods 
        Nine subjects performed 10-repetition maximum leg press exercise. MAP was estimated by finger photoplethysmography, Vmean by Doppler ultrasound, and end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) by mass spectrometry.
        Results 
        Vmean fluctuated with MAP with each repetition however averaged over the 10 repetitions, Vmean was unchanged from resting baseline values (66.9 ± 10.8 vs 67.7 ± 12.3 cm·s−1, baseline vs exercise, P {\textgreater} 0.05) despite an increased MAP (89.5 ± 8.4 vs 105.0 ± 4.9 Torr, P {\textless} 0.05). PETCO2 also remained unchanged from rest to exercise (37.7 ± 2.8 vs 36.6 ± 2.7 Torr, P {\textgreater} 0.05). Vmean decreased below resting levels for the first 5 s of recovery (59.8 ± 9.1 cm·s−1, P {\textless} 0.05) as MAP returned rapidly to slightly below baseline (83.3 ± 6.1, P {\textgreater} 0.05). MAP/Vmean, an index of cerebrovascular resistance, was elevated during exercise and returned to baseline after exercise. An increase in Vmean at 30 s post exercise (78.4 ± 10.6 cm·s−1, P {\textless} 0.05) corresponded with elevated PETCO2 (43.0 ± 4.8 Torr, P {\textgreater} 0.05).
        Conclusion 
        The results suggest that fluctuations in MAP with individual muscle contractions during resistance exercise appear to be too rapid to be countered by cerebrovascular autoregulation. However, the progressive increase in MAP over a number of contractions was effectively countered to maintain Vmean near baseline values before a decrease in Vmean immediately after exercise.},

	abstract = {Hyperventilation performed by athletes during preparation for resistance exercise might contribute to reports of postexercise orthostatic instability.
        Purpose: 
        To test the hypothesis that post-resistance exercise orthostatic instability is associated with exaggerated reductions of cerebral blood-flow velocity after hyperventilation.
        Methods: 
        We recorded the ECG, end-tidal CO2, beat-by-beat finger arterial pressure, and cerebral blood-flow velocity in 10 healthy subjects. Subjects performed 10 repetitions of recumbent leg press using resistance equivalent to 80\% of their six-repetition maximum during three separate trials (randomized): 1) no prior hyperventilation (NOHV); 2) after hyperventilation to an end-tidal CO2 of 3\% (HV3\%); and 3) after hyperventilation to an end-tidal CO2 of 2\% (HV2\%). After exercise, subjects stood upright for 10 s and rated symptoms of lightheadedness on a scale of 1 (none) to 5 (faint).
        Results: 
        Mean cerebral blood-flow velocity (CBFVMEAN) increased by 12\% during exercise after NOHV and decreased by 14 and 25\% during exercise after HV3\% and HV2\% (all P {\textless} 0.0001). During standing, mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased by 96 mm Hg and CBFVMEAN decreased by 41 cm·s−1 (pooled across conditions; all P {\textless} 0.0001). Absolute reductions of CBFVMEAN during standing were greater after HV2\% compared with both NOHV and HV3\% (P = 0.003). Ratings of perceived lightheadedness during standing increased with prior hyperventilation (P = 0.02) and correlated to the magnitude of reductions in MAP (r = 0.51; P = 0.003) and CBFVMEAN (r = 0.37; P = 0.04).
        Conclusions: 
        Hyperventilation before lower-body resistance exercise exacerbates CBFVMEAN reductions during standing. Increased symptoms of orthostatic instability are associated with the magnitude of reductions in both MAP and CBFVMEAN.},

	abstract = {Background: It is known that cerebral vasoreactivity is altered in adult arterial hypertension but no information is available about cerebral arteriolar function in hypertensive adolescents. Therefore, the aim of the present work was to assess cerebral vasoreactivity responses in adolescent hypertension. Methods: 113 hypertensive and 58 normotensive adolescents were assessed with transcranial Doppler sonography by using voluntary hyperventilation (HV) as vasoconstrictory stimulus. Absolute blood flow velocities (systolic, mean and diastolic) and pulsatility indices (PIs) at rest and after HV, as well as percentage change of the blood flow velocities after HV were compared among the groups. Results: Blood flow velocities at rest were significantly higher in hypertensive individuals, while PIs were similar in the two groups. After HV, all blood flow velocity parameters were higher among hypertensive teenagers than in healthy controls, while PIs did not differ between the two groups. Taking the relative changes after HV into account, it was found that HV induced a more pronounced change of the systolic and mean blood flow velocities of the control subjects than in hypertensive adolescents. Conclusions: Cerebrovascular reactivity to hypocapnia is decreased in hypertensive adolescents as compared to healthy teenagers. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of altered cerebral microvascular function in adolescent hypertension.

	abstract = {Arterial hypertension occurring during heavy resistance exercise may be a risk factor for stroke in healthy young adults. Any training method that ameliorates the pressor effect of exercise should reduce the risk of stroke. The objective of this study was to observe the influence of breathing technique on arterial blood pressure (BP) generated during heavy, dynamic weight lifting. BP was recorded in 10 male athletes by radial artery catheterization. Each subject then performed double-leg press sets at 85\% and 100\% of maximum. Each exercise was performed twice, once with closed glottis Valsalva, and then with slow exhalation during concentric contraction. The mean BP at 100\% maximum with Valsalva was 311/284. The highest pressure recorded in an individual was 370/360. With slow exhalation, the mean BP was 198/175 when the same 100\% maximum was lifted (p {\textless} .005). A reduced pressor response was also noted at 85\% maximal lifting with slow exhalation. Arterial hypertension produced during heavy weight lifting with Valsalva is extreme and may be dramatically reduced when the exercise is performed with an open glottis (without Valsalva). It is concluded that heavy resistance exercise is safer when performed while the subject breathes with an open glottis.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to record the blood pressure response to heavy weight-lifting exercise in five experienced body builders. Blood pressure was directly recorded by means of a capacitance transducer connected to a catheter in the brachial artery. Intrathoracic pressure with the Valsalva maneuver was recorded as mouth pressure by having the subject maintain an open glottis while expiring against a column of Hg during the lifts. Exercises included single-arm curls, overhead presses, and both double- and single-leg presses performed to failure at 80, 90, 95, and 100\% of maximum. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures rose rapidly to extremely high values during the concentric contraction phase for each lift and declined with the eccentric contraction. The greatest peak pressures occurred during the double-leg press where the mean value for the group was 320/250 mmHg, with pressures in one subject exceeding 480/350 mmHg. Peak pressures with the single-arm curl exercise reached a mean group value of 255/190 mmHg when repetitions were continued to failure. Mouth pressures of 30-50 Torr during a single maximum lift, or as subjects approached failure with a submaximal weight, indicate that a portion of the observed increase in blood pressure was caused by a Valsalva maneuver. It was concluded that when healthy young subjects perform weight-lifting exercises the mechanical compression of blood vessels combines with a potent pressor response and a Valsalva response to produce extreme elevations in blood pressure. Pressures are extreme even when exercise is performed with a relatively small muscle mass.},

Weight lifting at the same relative intensity produced similar increases in blood pressure, regardless of individual differences in muscle size or strength. Concentric, isometric, or eccentric exercise at the same relative intensity caused similar increases despite differences in force production. In weight lifting, the greatest increase in blood pressure occurred at the joint angle corresponding to the weakest point in the strength curve and the least at the angle corresponding to the strongest point. Isometric contractions of the same relative intensity at different joint angles produced identical blood pressures despite differences in absolute force production. When subjects attempted to maintain a maximum isometric contraction for 45 s, the blood pressure increase remained the same despite a marked diminution in force. Thus the magnitude of the blood pressure response depends on the degree of effort or central command and not actual force production. A brief Valsalva maneuver, which exaggerates the increase in blood pressure, is unavoidable when desired force production exceeds approximately 80\% maximum voluntary contraction.},

	abstract = {The traditional view that Richard Hooker argued for the religious authority of Scripture, reason, and tradition, in that order, has come under sustained criticism in recent years, especially from those scholars who assert that Hooker was in fact an orthodox Reformed theologian. Although Hooker placed a distinctively high value on the role of reason in authenticating Holy Scripture, it is claimed that this is fully compatible with the Protestant principle of sola Scriptura, and reflects wider developments in the Reformed tradition on the role of reason in proving that Scripture is divine revelation. This article seeks to refute these claims by examining Reformed thought on the religious authority of Scripture and reason in matters of Christian doctrine, looking at representatives from the Reformers, early orthodoxy, and high orthodoxy. This is then compared with Hooker's work, where, it is argued, the Reformed doctrine that Scripture is the principium cognoscendi theologiae, with reason merely an ancillary 'handmaid', is replaced by the radical position that Scripture and demonstrative reasoning are both principial authorities in matters of Christian doctrine. In propounding his triple-source theory of religious authority, therefore, Hooker is concluded to have broken fundamentally with the principle of sola Scriptura.},

The result is a characterization of 'generic open theism', the minimal set of commitments that any open theist, qua open theist, must affirm. Second, within the framework of generic open theism, I distinguish three important variants and discuss challenges distinctive to each. The significance of this approach is that it helps avoid conflating arguments bearing on specific versions of open theism with arguments pertaining to open theism simpliciter.},

	abstract = {Theodicy, the enterprise of searching for greater goods that might plausibly justify God's permission of evil, is often criticized on the grounds that the project has systematically failed to unearth any such goods. But theodicists also face a deeper challenge, one that places under question the very attempt to look for any morally sufficient reasons God might have for creating a world littered with evil. This 'anti-theodical' view argues that theists (and non-theists) ought to reject, primarily for moral reasons, the project of 'justifying the ways of God to men'. Unfortunately, this view has not received the serious attention it deserves, particularly in analytic philosophy of religion. Taking my cues from such anti-theodicists as Kenneth Surin, D.Z. Phillips and Dostoyevsky's Ivan Karamazov, I defend several reasons for holding that the way of thinking about God and evil enshrined in theodical discourse can only add to the world's evils, not remove or illuminate them.

Firstly, much of the critique begs the question because it presupposes something else to be true than what the theodicy claims; had the theodicy been true, it would not be immoral. Secondly, much of the moral critique shows situations where theodicies are inappropriate, and argues that they should never be communicated because of these situations. But if a theory is true, there will be some situations where it is appropriate to communicate it, and others where it is not. This is no basis for a moral dismissal of the theory.

The challenge is to explain why the hypothesis that there exists an omnipotent, omniscient and all-good god should be considered significantly more reasonable than the hypothesis that there exists an omnipotent, omniscient and all-evil god. Theists typically dismiss the evil-god hypothesis out of hand because of the problem of good–there is surely too much good in the world for it to be the creation of such a being. But then why doesn't the problem of evil provide equally good grounds for dismissing belief in a good god? I develop this evil-god challenge in detail, anticipate several replies, and correct errors made in earlier discussions of the problem of good.},

After a critical examination of the techniques used in empirical research, an alternative method is proposed which attempts to appreciate the way in which Evangelicals define themselves, theologically and in terms of their specific religious heritage. This overall effort is aimed at stimulating discussion on the strategies for developing consistent and phenomenologically sensitive ways of measuring the concept, Evangelical, in survey research.},

With great respect for the legacy of each man, but with critical insight as well, they suggest strengths and weaknesses of their apologetics. All the while they consider what Lewis and Schaeffer still have to offer in light of postmodernism and other cultural currents that, since their deaths, have changed the apologetic landscape.

	abstract = {Richard L. Rubenstein, who initiated the American debate about theological consequences of the Holocaust with the publication of After Auschwitz in 1966, is best known for his claim that God was dead. This proclamation of God's demise is usually understood as a result of reasoning that includes the occurrence of the Holocaust among its premises. In the article, the author presents an alternative interpretation. Analyzing Rubenstein's early essays, the author argues that his rejection of theodicy as traditionally construed and of the notion of God as the Lord of History should rather be read as a part of Rubenstein's critique of "ghetto Judaism"-Judaism born in tragic and anomalous circumstances of exile, containing intrinsically problematic ideas of God, divine providence, and divine election. Heavily influenced by existentialism in general and by Paul Tillich's rejection of traditional theism in particular, Rubenstein believed that traditional Judaism had outlived its purpose. In Rubenstein's thought, Auschwitz-and those interpretations of the Holocaust that attempted to place it within the parameters of traditional vocabulary and the covenantal framework-the author submits, serves primarily as the most glaring example of the bankruptcy of "ghetto Judaism" and its God. It is not, however, the reason for this God's death and Rubenstein's argument is logically independent of the fact of the Holocaust.},

	abstract = {Two responses in this volume are of great interest because they are so diametrically opposed to the "death-of-God" theology. One is the analysis of Jewish responses to radical theology provided by Timothy A. Bennett and Rochelle L. Millen. They report, for example, on Emil Fackenheim's argument ascribing "the valorization of the death of God to a deep anti-Jewish element in Christianity" (p. 114). Fackenheim interprets [Altizer]'s claim that God's death must be willed because God is "the transcendent enemy of the fullness and the passion of man's life in the world" [Altizer] as identifying humanity's "transcendent enemy" with the God of Israel. One must ask at the same time, it would seem, whether [Rubenstein]'s own "new Jewish paganism" is not also deeply anti-Jewish.
The other is Hubert Locke's "African-American Perspective" (pp. 91-97) on the death of God. Locke finds that three ironies are encountered when African-Americans examine "radical theology." They are: (1) that God's death was proclaimed at precisely the time when black Christians were giving powerful expression to the opposite conviction; (2) that both Black theology and radical theology drew on the experiences of Jewish people, with Black theology finding hope in the Exodus while radical theology found despair in the Holocaust; and (3) Black theologians find that Black people were left out of account in [Langdon Gilkey]'s claim that radical theology presents "the mind of modern urban man" (p. 94); Black Americans, says Locke, were at the time "marveling at the apparent presence of the God of justice in the unfolding civil rights revolution of the decade" (p. 95). It is quite a comment on the death of God theologians that the Americans who had the most first-hand experience of suffering and oppression identify with the Jewish message of hope and justice while those who had the least proclaimed, whatever it might have meant, that God had "died."},
